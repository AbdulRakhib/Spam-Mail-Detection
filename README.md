The Spam Mail Detection project is a machine learning project that aims to build a model that can classify emails as spam or not spam. The project uses a dataset of emails that are labeled as either spam or not spam, and the model is trained on this dataset using various machine learning algorithms.

The project performs exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and identify any trends or patterns. This includes visualizing the frequency of words in spam and non-spam emails, as well as using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to visualize the data in 2D and identify any clusters.

After data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, the project moves on to building machine learning models to classify emails as spam or not spam. The models used are KNN and Decision Tree. The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Overall, the Spam Mail Detection project is a comprehensive machine learning project that covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and model evaluation. The project provides a good example of how to approach a real-world machine learning problem and demonstrates the importance of careful data preprocessing and thorough model evaluation.
